### Bookish — Book Wishlist Web App

**Live Preview:** [bookish on GitHub](https://github.com/Mwirigikelvinkubai/bookish_myApp)

---

### Overview

**Bookish** is a React-based web app that lets users search books via the Open Library API and save them to a personalized wishlist. The app supports user registration and login, and each user’s wishlist is stored individually using a db.json.

Whether you're keeping track of your next read or just building your dream bookshelf, **Bookish** makes it smooth and aesthetic.

###  Features

- **Search Books** – Lookup books using Open Library’s public API.
- **User Auth** – Register, login, and sign out securely.
-  **Wishlist** – Add or remove books from your personal list.
- **User-specific Data** – Wishlists tied to individual users only.
- **Route Protection** – Only logged-in users can access or modify their wishlist.
- **Context API** – Global state management for auth and book data.
- **Fake Backend** – Powered by `json-server` for local storage and testing.

 How It Works
Users can register with email, password, and optional details like name.

Once signed in, they can search for books and click a to save them.

Each wishlist is unique to the user and synced with the local json-server.

Signing out resets the app state and prevents wishlist interactions until re-login.

Non-auth users are redirected to the login page with a prompt if they try to wishlist.
